   <h3>A funny story</h3>
   <p>When i was 16 years old i went on a roadtrip with friends.
   Driving trough germany. A friend told me that every sign that said "Ausfahrt" will lead you to the biggest city of Germany.
   Of course i didn't do well in school. Haha. With other words i thought it was true.
   After maybe eight signs i realized it actually meant exit!
     I was forced to listen to this joke during the entire ten day roadtrip</p>

   <h4>Tl DR</h4>
   <p>Being a dumb teenager and only caring about the stuff you like at that time was fun!
     Time for Reality</p>
