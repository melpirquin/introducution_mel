   <h3>A funny story</h3>
   When i was 16 years old i went on a roadtrip with friends.
   Driving trough germany. A friend told me that every sign that said "Ausfahrt" will lead you to the biggest city of Germany.
   Of course i didn't do well in school. Haha. With other words i thought it was true.
   After maybe 8 signs i realized it actually meant Exit!
   I was forced to listen to this joke during the entire 10 day trip

   <h4>TlDR</h4>
   Being a dumb teenager and only caring about the stuff you like at that time was fun!
   Time for Reality
